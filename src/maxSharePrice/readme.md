You have an array P: [140,60, ...., 120,132] includes everyday Share Price from last year,
You can only buy one share at one day and sell one share at any later day to make profit.

What is the highest profit you can make?

SP in the first day is P[0]: 	140
SP in the fifth day is P[4]: 	80
â€¦
SP in the last day is P[364]: 	132
